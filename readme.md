Description:
This a game kinda like battleship inspired by John Carpenter’s Escape From New York.
It doesn’t make that much sense because it is basically battle ship re-skinned to showcase Kurt Russell in all of his glory, which I think is awesome.

I created it using basic html, css, JS, jQuery and bootStrap.

JS/jQ:
—-Used JS/jQ to create a styled grid of clickable elements.

—-Move counter/ hit counter does not increase when you click on a square that was already clicked. Instead you get a sweet alert that informs you of your incompetence.

——added sound effects. rather than creating a seperate function for each sound effect, I used script off of gitHub from some dude who goes by the name of Alexander Manzyuk and is associated with some kind of college called MIT…


bootStrap:
——Used bootStrap for rows and columns.

——Used sweetAlerts for Wins and repeated moves.



Still working out random placement of the “ships”, or whatever you want to call it.
Since i couldn’t figure out random placement, this App will never be impressed by your performance and will always give you a thumbs down at the end, no matter how many moves.
